<body style="background-color:powderblue;">

Background color is power blue
<p>This is a paragraph, default font, size, color, and so on</p>
<h1 style="color:white">Heading 1 in white</h1>
<h3 style="color:cyan">Heading 3 in cyan</h3>

A 2x2 unstyled table is next
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>One</td>
		<td>Two</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Three</td>
		<td>Four</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Should see a line next</p>
<hr>
<p>A paragraph with a line break,<br>which comes in handy ones in a while</p>
<p>HTML is <i>really</i> (use i for italic), <strong>REALLY</strong> fun! (use strong for strong)</p>
